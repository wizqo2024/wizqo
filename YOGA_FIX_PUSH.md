# Push Yoga Progress Fix

Same Git corruption persists. Use the successful orphan branch method in Shell:

```bash
rm -f .git/index.lock
git checkout --orphan yoga-fix-push
git add .
git commit -m "Fix yoga plan progress tracking - resolve case sensitivity bug"
git push https://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@github.com/wizqo2024/HobbyPlanGen.git yoga-fix-push:main --force
```

## Fix Details:
- Fixed case sensitivity in plan lookup (Yoga vs yoga)
- Added fallback search for broader plan matching
- Enhanced session storage progress restoration
- Better debugging for plan identification issues

This should resolve the issue where your completed yoga days reset to Day 1.
