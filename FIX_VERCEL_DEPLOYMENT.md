# Fix Vercel Deployment - Author Email Issue

## Problem
- Code successfully pushed to GitHub (8ae3672 -> main)
- Vercel deployment failing: "No GitHub account was found matching the commit author email address"

## Solution: Fix Author Email and Re-push

```bash
# Set correct Git author info
git config user.email "wizqo2024@gmail.com"
git config user.name "wizqo2024"

# Amend the last commit with correct author
git commit --amend --author="wizqo2024 <wizqo2024@gmail.com>" --no-edit

# Push with corrected author info
git push "$GIT_URL" independence-migration:main --force

# Verify the fix worked
git log --oneline -1
```

This will update the commit author to match your GitHub account, allowing Vercel to deploy your smart hobby detection improvements.
