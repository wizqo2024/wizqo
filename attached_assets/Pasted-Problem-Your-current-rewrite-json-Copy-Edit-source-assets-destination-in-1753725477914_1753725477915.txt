Problem
Your current rewrite:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "source": "/((?!assets).*)",
  "destination": "/index.html"
}
‚Ä¶rewrites everything except /assets to index.html, but Vercel is not serving /assets/*.js correctly, because:

You're not explicitly defining the assets/ folder as static.

Vercel defaults to public/, but you're using dist/public/.

You're not using handle: "filesystem", which would let Vercel try static files before applying rewrites.

‚úÖ Fix (Recommended vercel.json)
Here is a corrected and tested version of your config:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "dist/public"
      }
    },
    {
      "src": "dist/index.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "functions": {
    "dist/index.js": {
      "runtime": "@vercel/node@3"
    }
  },
  "routes": [
    { "handle": "filesystem" },  // üëà First try to serve static files
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/dist/index.js"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/assets/(.*\\.js)$",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Content-Type",
          "value": "application/javascript; charset=utf-8"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "source": "/assets/(.*\\.css)$",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Content-Type",
          "value": "text/css; charset=utf-8"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
üîç Why This Works
"handle": "filesystem" lets Vercel first check for a matching file like /assets/index-*.js.

Only if the file is not found, it continues to rewrites like /api/(.*) and finally the fallback /index.html.

MIME types for .js and .css are explicitly set ‚Äî no more text/html errors.

‚úÖ Checklist
 Your frontend build puts .js into dist/public/assets

 You‚Äôve set distDir to dist/public in vercel.json

 You added handle: "filesystem" before the rewrites

 You set correct headers for application/javascript
