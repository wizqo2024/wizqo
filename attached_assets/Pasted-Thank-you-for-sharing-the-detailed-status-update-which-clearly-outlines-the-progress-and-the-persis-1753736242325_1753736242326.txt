Thank you for sharing the detailed status update, which clearly outlines the progress and the persistent issue with Vercel’s CDN serving stale content and incorrect MIME types. The key problems are:

Vercel CDN Cache Persistence: The CDN is serving a stale deployment (etag: 0058329ff2e8fa2fa71b2d488a9a534b), causing index.html to reference the outdated index-G9WQI6ms.js instead of the new index-CWH0ADpq.js.
MIME Type Issue: JavaScript files are served as text/html, triggering the browser error Failed to load module script.
Asset Hash Mismatch: The production index.html references an old JavaScript file, indicating the cached index.html isn’t updating.
Given that you’ve already applied a correct vercel.json with no-cache headers, forced redeployments, and confirmed the build works locally, the issue is likely Vercel’s aggressive CDN caching or a project-specific configuration error. Since you’ve asked whether to delete the Vercel project and GitHub repository, and considering the repeated failed attempts to clear the cache, deleting and redoing the Vercel project is a reasonable next step to bypass the CDN issue. However, deleting the GitHub repository is unnecessary unless you suspect file corruption. Below is a plan to either fix the issue one final time or cleanly delete and redo the Vercel project, with a fallback to alternative platforms like Netlify if needed.

Final Attempt to Fix on Vercel
Before deleting, let’s try one last fix to ensure we’ve exhausted all options, focusing on cache invalidation and verifying the build pipeline.

Update vercel.json with Aggressive No-Cache Headers:
Ensure your vercel.json forces no caching for all critical assets to bypass the CDN:
json



{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/assets/(.*)\\.js",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Content-Type",
          "value": "application/javascript"
        },
        {
          "key": "Cache-Control",
          "value": "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "source": "/assets/(.*)\\.css",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Content-Type",
          "value": "text/css"
        },
        {
          "key": "Cache-Control",
          "value": "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "source": "/(.*\\.html)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Content-Type",
          "value": "text/html"
        },
        {
          "key": "Cache-Control",
          "value": "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/assets/(.*)",
      "destination": "/assets/$1"
    },
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
Commit and push:
bash




git add vercel.json
git commit -m "Force no-cache headers for all assets"
git push origin main
Clear Vite Build Cache and Rebuild:
Clear Vite’s cache to ensure a fresh build:
bash




rm -rf node_modules/.vite dist
npm run build
Verify dist/index.html references index-CWH0ADpq.js:
bash




cat dist/index.html | grep index-CWH0ADpq.js
Expected output:
text



<script type="module" src="/assets/index-CWH0ADpq.js"></script>
Confirm index-CWH0ADpq.js exists:
bash




ls -la dist/assets/index-CWH0ADpq.js
Commit the dist/ folder (if included in your repo):
bash




git add dist/
git commit -m "Add fresh build with correct asset hashes"
git push origin main
Force Redeploy with Vercel CLI:
Install Vercel CLI locally (if not already installed):
bash




npm install -g vercel
Clear any local Vercel cache:
bash




rm -rf .vercel
Redeploy with force:
bash




vercel --prod --force
This bypasses cached build artifacts and triggers a fresh deployment.
Test the Deployment:
Check the JavaScript file:
bash




curl -I https://www.wizqo.com/assets/index-CWH0ADpq.js
Expected output:
text



HTTP/2 200
content-type: application/javascript
cache-control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
Check index.html:
bash




curl -s https://www.wizqo.com/ | grep index-CWH0ADpq.js
Expected output:
text



<script type="module" src="/assets/index-CWH0ADpq.js"></script>
Open https://www.wizqo.com in an incognito browser window and use DevTools (Network tab) to confirm index-CWH0ADpq.js loads with Content-Type: application/javascript.
Contact Vercel Support:
If the above fails, contact Vercel support before deleting the project:
Go to Vercel dashboard > “Support” > submit a ticket.
Provide:
Deployment URL
vercel.json content
curl -I https://www.wizqo.com/assets/index-CWH0ADpq.js output
Build logs from the Vercel dashboard
