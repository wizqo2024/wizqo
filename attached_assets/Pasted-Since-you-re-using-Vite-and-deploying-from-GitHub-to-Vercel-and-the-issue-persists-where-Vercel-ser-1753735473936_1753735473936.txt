Since you're using Vite and deploying from GitHub to Vercel, and the issue persists where Vercel serves JavaScript files (e.g., index-G9WQI6ms.js) with a text/html MIME type instead of application/javascript, causing the browser error Failed to load module script, let’s address this with a Vite- and GitHub-specific approach. The error suggests Vercel is still redirecting or rewriting requests for JavaScript files to index.html, likely due to a misconfiguration in vercel.json, Vite’s build output, or Vercel’s caching. Below is a targeted solution to fix the MIME type issue.

Problem Recap
Error: Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "text/html".
Cause: Vercel serves index.html with content-type: text/html for requests to /assets/index-G9WQI6ms.js, likely due to a catch-all rewrite rule or cached response.
Setup: You’re using Vite, deploying via GitHub to Vercel, and the previous curl -I output showed x-vercel-cache: HIT with content-type: text/html.
Solution
To resolve this, we need to ensure Vite’s build output is correctly structured, vercel.json properly handles static assets, and Vercel’s cache is cleared. Here’s a step-by-step fix:

Verify Vite Build Output:
Run the Vite build locally or in your CI pipeline to confirm the output structure:
bash




npm run build
ls -la dist/assets/
Vite typically outputs to dist/ with assets in dist/assets/. Ensure index-G9WQI6ms.js exists in dist/assets/.
Check dist/index.html to confirm the script tag references the correct path:
html



<script type="module" src="/assets/index-G9WQI6ms.js"></script>
If the src path is incorrect (e.g., missing /assets/), adjust Vite’s base configuration in vite.config.js:
javascript




// vite.config.js
export default {
  base: '/', // Ensure this matches your deployment root
  build: {
    outDir: 'dist', // Default, but confirm it’s not changed
    assetsDir: 'assets' // Default, ensure assets are in dist/assets/
  }
}
Update vercel.json:
Ensure your GitHub repository’s root contains a vercel.json file to enforce correct MIME types and routing for static assets. Use the following configuration:
json



{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/assets/(.*)\\.js",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Content-Type",
          "value": "application/javascript"
        },
        {
          "key": "Cache-Control",
          "value": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "source": "/assets/(.*)\\.css",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Content-Type",
          "value": "text/css"
        },
        {
          "key": "Cache-Control",
          "value": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/assets/(.*)",
      "destination": "/assets/$1"
    },
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
Explanation:
The headers section sets Content-Type: application/javascript for .js files and text/css for .css files.
The rewrites ensure /assets/* requests serve files from the dist/assets/ directory, while other requests fall back to index.html for SPA routing.
The order is critical: asset-specific rules must come before the catch-all.
Commit and Push to GitHub:
Update vercel.json in your GitHub repository’s root.
Commit and push changes:
bash




git add vercel.json vite.config.js
git commit -m "Fix MIME type issue with vercel.json and Vite config"
git push origin main
Ensure your GitHub repository is linked to Vercel, so the push triggers a new deployment.
Clear Vercel Cache and Redeploy:
Since your previous curl -I showed x-vercel-cache: HIT, stale cache entries may be causing the issue. Trigger a fresh deployment:
In the Vercel dashboard, go to your project, select “Deployments,” and click “Redeploy” on the latest deployment.
Alternatively, use the Vercel CLI locally (if set up):
bash




vercel --prod
To force cache invalidation, you can temporarily add a no-cache header in vercel.json for debugging:
json



{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/assets/(.*)\\.js",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Content-Type",
          "value": "application/javascript"
        },
        {
          "key": "Cache-Control",
          "value": "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
Revert to max-age=31536000, immutable after confirming the fix.
Verify Deployment:
After deployment, test the JavaScript file’s MIME type:
bash




curl -I https://www.wizqo.com/assets/index-G9WQI6ms.js
Expected output:
text



HTTP/2 200
content-type: application/javascript
cache-control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
If it still shows content-type: text/html, check the Vercel deployment logs for errors.
Check Vercel Build Settings:
In the Vercel dashboard, go to your project’s “Settings” > “General”:
Ensure the “Build Command” is set to vite build (or your custom build script from package.json).
Ensure the “Output Directory” is set to dist.
Ensure the “Root Directory” is set to / (or the directory containing dist/ and vercel.json).
If using a custom GitHub workflow, verify your .github/workflows/vercel.yml (if present) runs the correct build and deploy steps:
yaml



name: Deploy to Vercel
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run build
      - uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v25
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
          vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
Test in Browser:
Open https://www.wizqo.com in an incognito window.
Use DevTools (Network tab) to verify that index-G9WQI6ms.js loads with Content-Type: application/javascript.
If the error persists, check for 404s or redirects in the Network tab and note the response body (e.g., curl -s https://www.wizqo.com/assets/index-G9WQI6ms.js).
If the Issue Persists
Inspect Build Logs:
In the Vercel dashboard, check the latest deployment’s build logs for errors related to asset uploads or vercel.json parsing.
Verify Asset Paths:
Run:
bash




cat dist/index.html | grep index-G9WQI6ms.js
Ensure the script tag’s src matches /assets/index-G9WQI6ms.js.
Debug Cache:
Temporarily set Cache-Control: no-cache in vercel.json and redeploy.
Test with curl -I again.
Share Debugging Info:
Provide:
Output of curl -I https://www.wizqo.com/assets/index-G9WQI6ms.js
Contents of vite.config.js
Vercel deployment logs (from the dashboard)
package.json build script
Contact Vercel Support:
Share:
Deployment URL
vercel.json content
curl -I output
Build logs
Mention that .js files are served as text/html despite correct vercel.json headers.
Additional Notes
Vite-Specific: If Vite’s base is set incorrectly (e.g., to a subdirectory), it can cause asset paths to mismatch. Ensure base: '/' unless your app is deployed to a subdirectory.
GitHub Integration: Confirm that Vercel is pulling the correct branch (e.g., main) and that vercel.json is included in the Git commit.
Module Scripts: The error mentions “module scripts,” which require application/javascript. The provided vercel.json ensures this MIME type.
Next Steps
Update vite.config.js and vercel.json in your GitHub repository.
Commit and push changes to trigger a Vercel deployment.
Test with curl -I https://www.wizqo.com/assets/index-G9WQI6ms.js.
If the issue persists, share the debugging info listed above.
