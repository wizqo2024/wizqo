What's Happening?
Vercel is treating your app as a static site (HTML + JS + CSS), not a proper framework-based project (like React, Next.js, etc.). That’s why:

JS files are showing as 0.0 B (likely served with incorrect MIME type or not bundled correctly)

Your API/Node function /server/index.ts is recognized separately but not integrated

Vercel can’t detect a build step or framework (e.g., no vercel-build command or correct outputDirectory)

✅ Immediate Fix Plan
🔧 Step 1: Correct vercel.json
Update your vercel.json to explicitly tell Vercel where your build output is, and how to treat backend vs frontend:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build"
    },
    {
      "src": "server/index.ts",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    { "handle": "filesystem" },
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/server/index.ts"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/dist/public/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*\\.js)$",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Content-Type",
          "value": "application/javascript; charset=utf-8"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "source": "/(.*\\.css)$",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Content-Type",
          "value": "text/css; charset=utf-8"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
📁 Ensure Correct File Locations:
Make sure your directory structure looks something like:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
root/
├── dist/
│   └── public/
│       ├── index.html
│       ├── index-*.js
│       └── index-*.css
├── server/
│   └── index.ts
├── vercel.json
├── package.json
🛠️ Step 2: Add vercel-build Script to package.json
json
Copy
Edit
"scripts": {
  "build": "vite build", 
  "vercel-build": "vite build"
}
If you're using Vite, that vite build command will generate output into dist (or wherever you’ve configured).

🌐 Step 3: Deploy Again
Push your changes to GitHub

Go to Vercel → Deployments → Click "Redeploy"

OR just push to main again to auto-deploy

🧠 Why This Fixes It
Vercel is currently confused by your structure (sees static files, no framework, no clear build step).

By adding a vercel.json, you're telling Vercel how to route, build, and serve your app.

MIME issues and framework detection errors are resolved when static assets are correctly typed and functions are separated.
