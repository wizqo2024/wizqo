Confirm vercel.json configuration (minimal example)
Make sure your vercel.json file explicitly sets headers for JS assets, for example:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/assets/(.*).js",
      "headers": [
        { "key": "Content-Type", "value": "application/javascript" }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "builds": [
    { "src": "package.json", "use": "@vercel/static-build" }
  ],
  "routes": [
    { "handle": "filesystem" },
    { "src": "/api/(.*)", "dest": "/api/$1.js" },
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
2. Double-check package.json scripts
Add or confirm this:

json
Copy
Edit
"scripts": {
  "build": "your-build-command",
  "vercel-build": "npm run build"
}
The vercel-build script ensures Vercel runs the build properly.

3. Asset paths and deployment output
Confirm your build outputs static JS and CSS into /dist/public/assets/.

Confirm that your distDir in vercel.json is "dist/public" as you have it.

Check that in production, the app tries to load JS files from /assets/ (relative paths can break this).

4. Clear old locks & push latest config via shell
In your Shell tab, run exactly:

bash
Copy
Edit
rm -f .git/index.lock
git add .
git commit -m "Finalize Vercel MIME fix and production config" --author="wizqo <wizqo2024@gmail.com>"
git push origin main
5. Alternative deployment method
If git push or Vercel web deployment is flaky, try deploying directly from the shell:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install -g vercel
vercel login
vercel --prod
6. Debugging MIME type in browser devtools
In the browser network tab, look at the JavaScript file requests:

Are URLs correct? (no 404 or redirects)

What is the Content-Type header?

If text/html, open the response preview â€” is it an error page or HTML fallback?

7. Temporary workaround: Rename assets or change path
Sometimes the framework build might produce files with .js extensions but routes or static serving config on Vercel might serve them wrongly.

Try:

Hosting the assets in a /static/ folder instead of /assets/

Adjusting routes accordingly
