Sandbox Attribute Error
Error while parsing the 'sandbox' attribute: 'allow-downloads-without-user-activation' is an invalid sandbox flag.

Explanation:
The sandbox attribute on an iframe has a limited list of allowed values.
allow-downloads-without-user-activation is not a valid flag, which causes the parser to throw this error.

Fix:
Replace or remove the invalid flag. Use only supported flags such as:

html
Copy
Edit
sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-downloads"
‚ö†Ô∏è Unrecognized Feature Policy Warnings
e.g., 'ambient-light-sensor', 'battery', 'execution-while-not-rendered', etc.

Explanation:
These are Feature Policy (now called Permissions Policy) features that are not recognized or supported by all browsers.

Fix:
You can safely ignore these unless you‚Äôre explicitly using them. If you're setting them in headers or meta tags, remove them if unused.

relation "public.hobby_plans" does not exist
Explanation:

Define appropriate schema (columns, types, etc.)

‚ö†Ô∏è PWA Banner Not Shown
beforeinstallprompt.preventDefault() called but not .prompt()

Explanation:
This warning means the "Add to Home Screen" prompt was blocked but never shown. It only appears if you‚Äôre building a Progressive Web App.

Fix:
Call .prompt() when the user takes a clear action (like clicking a button).

‚úÖ Sign-In Status Logs (Safe)
Auth state changed: SIGNED_IN, etc.

These are normal logs indicating your app‚Äôs authentication state is working.

üß† Final Notes:
To fully resolve errors:

‚úÖ Remove unsupported sandbox and permission policies.

‚úÖ Check headers or <iframe> usage for unsupported values.

‚úÖ Create required Supabase tables or adjust your API queries.

‚úÖ Only use permissions-policy features supported by browsers.
