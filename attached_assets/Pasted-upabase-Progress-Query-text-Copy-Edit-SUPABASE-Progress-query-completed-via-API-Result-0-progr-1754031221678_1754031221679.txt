upabase Progress Query

📖 SUPABASE: Progress query completed via API. Result: 0 progress entries
🛑 You’re not receiving any user progress, even though you're signed in.

This almost certainly confirms:

The progress INSERT is failing, likely due to missing RLS permissions, as seen in previous 401 error.

Your app continues but cannot associate a plan with progress, which is why:

Edit
📍 Dashboard: Navigating to plan: undefined
📍 Loading plan from session: undefined
✅ Using plan data from state: undefined
🔄 Initializing with existing plan data: undefined
🧠 What’s Broken?
Likely causes:
Progress is never being inserted into user_progress (due to RLS policy or DB error).

Because of that, the app has no plan_id to load into the session or dashboard → everything becomes undefined.

✅ What You Should Do Now
🔧 Step 1: Add a Row-Level Security Policy to user_progress
Go to Supabase → Table Editor → user_progress table → "RLS" tab → Add a new policy like this:

Example SQL Policy:
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE POLICY "Allow insert for owner"
ON public.user_progress
FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
Also add (optional but good practice):

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE POLICY "Allow select for owner"
ON public.user_progress
FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
Make sure RLS is enabled for the table.

🧪 Step 2: Manually Try to Insert a user_progress Row
In the Supabase SQL editor, try something like:

sql
Copy
Edit
INSERT INTO user_progress (user_id, plan_id, day)
VALUES ('773c3f18-025a-432d-ae3d-fa13be3faef8', 'some-valid-plan-id', 1);
Does it succeed now? If so, the policy is working.

✅ Step 3: Re-Trigger Your App’s Initialization Logic
Either:

Clear your localStorage / sessionStorage to simulate a new user.

Sign out and back in.

That should trigger the initializeProgress() logic in your app, now allowed by RLS.

📌 Extra Cleanups / Notes
All the Unrecognized feature: ... and Refused to frame errors are just browser warnings and do not impact core app logic.

The plan: undefined and Using plan data from state: undefined logs confirm your app is trying to load a plan, but none is selected because no progress exists.

Make sure your app's logic for navigateToPlan(planId) or equivalent isn’t assuming progress always exists — wrap it in a check.
