Key points about your vercel.json headers snippet:

-    {      
-      "source": "/assets/(.*\\.js)$",      
-      "headers": [        
-        {          
-          "key": "Content-Type",          
-          "value": "application/javascript; charset=utf-8"        
-        }        
-        { "key": "Content-Type", "value": "application/javascript" }      
-      ]    
-    },
+    {      
+      "source": "/assets/(.*).js",      
+      "headers": [        
+        { "key": "Content-Type", "value": "application/javascript" }      
+      ]    
+    },
You removed duplicate source keys and duplicate Content-Type headers. That's good, JSON objects cannot have duplicate keys.

The source pattern was simplified from regex with $ to a simpler glob-like pattern. This is acceptable if Vercel treats it as a glob.

You dropped charset=utf-8 from the Content-Type header, which is generally fine for JS files (optional).

Recommendations:
Confirm your full vercel.json looks like this minimal example:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/assets/(.*).js",
      "headers": [
        { "key": "Content-Type", "value": "application/javascript" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "source": "/assets/(.*).css",
      "headers": [
        { "key": "Content-Type", "value": "text/css" }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "builds": [
    { "src": "package.json", "use": "@vercel/static-build" }
  ],
  "routes": [
    { "handle": "filesystem" },
    { "src": "/api/(.*)", "dest": "/api/$1.js" },
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
Make sure your frontend build outputs all static JS and CSS files under /dist/public/assets/ and the paths your app uses in HTML reference /assets/*.js and /assets/*.css.

In your package.json scripts, confirm:

json
Copy
Edit
"scripts": {
  "build": "your-build-command",
  "vercel-build": "npm run build"
}
Clear git locks and push the changes with your specific commit author as you described:

bash
Copy
Edit
rm -f .git/index.lock
git add .
git commit -m "Finalize Vercel MIME fix and production config" --author="wizqo <wizqo2024@gmail.com>"
git push origin main
Use Vercel CLI to deploy directly if Git deployment issues persist:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install -g vercel
vercel login
vercel --prod
Check browser devtools (Network tab) after deployment:

Look at the JS files requests: Are they returning 200 OK?

Confirm Content-Type header is application/javascript.

If still served as text/html, open the response preview to check if it’s your index.html or an error page.

If you still get text/html for .js files, a likely cause is:

The path /assets/*.js is being routed to your SPA fallback (index.html).

This happens if files are missing or not uploaded properly.

Double-check the deployment output folder contents.

Quick sanity check
Run locally:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run build
npx serve dist/public
Visit http://localhost:5000/assets/yourfile.js and verify the file loads with correct Content-Type.

Summary
Your minimal vercel.json looks correct if fully applied and the build output is correct. The main reasons for text/html served on .js are:

Asset files not actually deployed or path mismatches → fallback to SPA index.html

Vercel build config or routes misdirecting asset requests

If you want, I can help you review your entire vercel.json and package.json files or generate a fully tested minimal config based on your project structure.
