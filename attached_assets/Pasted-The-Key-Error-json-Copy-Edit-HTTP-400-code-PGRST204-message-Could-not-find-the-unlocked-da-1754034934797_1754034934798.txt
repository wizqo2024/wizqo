HTTP 400: {"code":"PGRST204","message":"Could not find the 'unlocked_days' column of 'user_progress' in the schema cache"}
This means that your code is trying to read/write to a column named unlocked_days in the user_progress table, but Supabase doesn‚Äôt recognize that column. The most common causes:

‚úÖ How to Fix It
1. Check if the unlocked_days column exists
Log into Supabase ‚Üí go to the user_progress table:

If unlocked_days is missing, you need to add it.

Type: Likely should be integer[] (array of ints) or jsonb, depending on your logic.

sql
Copy
Edit
-- Example if you're using integer arrays
ALTER TABLE user_progress ADD COLUMN unlocked_days integer[];

-- Or if using JSON
-- ALTER TABLE user_progress ADD COLUMN unlocked_days jsonb;
üìå Choose the correct type that matches how your frontend/backend expects to use it.

2. Refresh Supabase Schema Cache
Sometimes, even after adding a column, the PostgREST layer may not pick it up. To force a refresh:

Go to Project Settings ‚Üí API ‚Üí Regenerate API Cache.

Or: make a dummy schema change (e.g., rename a column temporarily) and revert it.

3. Check for Supabase Row-Level Security (RLS)
Make sure you have RLS policies that allow read/write access to the unlocked_days column:

sql
Copy
Edit
-- Basic example policy
CREATE POLICY "Allow access to user_progress" ON user_progress
FOR ALL
USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
üß™ Optional: Log the payload
Also confirm that your frontend is sending a valid payload. Console logs mention:

js
Copy
Edit
HobbyPlanService.updateProgress(...)
You might want to console.log the updatePayload or inspect the network request to ensure unlocked_days is part of the body and matches the expected structure.
