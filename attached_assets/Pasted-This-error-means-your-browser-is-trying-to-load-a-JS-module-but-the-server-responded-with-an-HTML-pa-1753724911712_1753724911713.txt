This error means your browser is trying to load a JS module but the server responded with an HTML page (usually your index.html), causing the MIME type mismatch.

Common causes & fixes for this on Vercel:
1. Static file routing issue
Your JS fileâ€™s URL is serving your main HTML page instead of the actual .js file.

Check your vercel.json routes:

Make sure static assets (JS, CSS) are served from the correct folder (dist/public/assets).

Your catch-all route for /(.*) should fallback only after static assets are handled.

Static file serving should handle requests to /assets/* and not redirect them to index.html

Example vercel.json snippet:

Edit
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    { "src": "package.json", "use": "@vercel/static-build", "config": { "distDir": "dist/public" } },
    { "src": "dist/index.js", "use": "@vercel/node" }
  ],
  "routes": [
    { "handle": "filesystem" },        // Serve static files from /dist/public/assets automatically
    { "src": "/api/(.*)", "dest": "/dist/index.js" },
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/dist/public/index.html" }
  ],
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/assets/(.*\\.js)$",
      "headers": [{ "key": "Content-Type", "value": "application/javascript; charset=utf-8" }]
    },
    {
      "source": "/assets/(.*\\.css)$",
      "headers": [{ "key": "Content-Type", "value": "text/css; charset=utf-8" }]
    }
  ]
}
2. Double-check your build output
Confirm the .js file actually exists at dist/public/assets/index-G9WQI6ms.js (or whatever your bundle is named).

The browser should be requesting /assets/index-G9WQI6ms.js and getting that JS file, not your HTML.

3. Clear cache / force reload
Sometimes browsers cache erroneous responses. Do a hard refresh or clear cache when testing.

4. Test URL directly
Open your deployed URL in browser:

Navigate directly to your JS file URL, e.g. https://your-domain.com/assets/index-G9WQI6ms.js

Confirm it serves JS, not HTML.

Summary
Your MIME error means the JS file URL is serving your HTML (index.html) instead of JS.

Fix your routing so static assets are served correctly (use "handle": "filesystem" route first).

Add explicit headers for JS and CSS for correct MIME types.

Confirm your build outputs the files where Vercel expects them.
