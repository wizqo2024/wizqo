Supabase user_progress table update failing due to RLS (Row-Level Security)
pgsql

‚ùå PROGRESS: Failed to update progress: 401 {"code":"42501","message":"new row violates row-level security policy for table \"user_progress\""}
This means that your Supabase table user_progress has row-level security enabled, but your policy is not allowing the insert or update operation.

‚úÖ Here's how to fix it:
Go to your Supabase project.

Navigate to Table Editor ‚Üí user_progress ‚Üí Row Level Security.

Ensure Row-Level Security (RLS) is enabled (it is, based on the error).

Add or update a policy to allow insert/update for authenticated users. Here's a basic example you can try:

‚úÖ Policy: Allow insert/update for the authenticated user
sql
Copy
Edit
-- INSERT policy
CREATE POLICY "Allow insert for authenticated users"
ON user_progress
FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
USING (
  auth.uid() = user_id
);

-- UPDATE policy
CREATE POLICY "Allow update for authenticated users"
ON user_progress
FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (
  auth.uid() = user_id
);
Make sure the table has a user_id column that matches the currently logged-in user's auth.uid().

üß™ After applying the policies:
Retry marking the day as complete.

If still broken, check the Supabase logs or inspect the network tab for any additional clues.

‚ùì Bonus: What about the other warnings?
These are non-blocking browser console warnings and can be safely ignored unless you're trying to clean up all noise:
