1. Force Clear CDN Cache / Browser Cache
Vercel sometimes caches previous routes and headers; clear cache in the Vercel dashboard under your project > Settings > Cache or redeploy forcing cache busting.

Hard refresh your browser or test in incognito mode.

2. Double-check the Route Order in vercel.json
Routes in Vercel are matched top-down. Ensure that the static asset route comes before the fallback route:

json
Copy
Edit
"routes": [
  { "handle": "filesystem" },
  { "src": "/api/(.*)", "dest": "/server/index.ts" },
  { "src": "/assets/(.*)", "dest": "/dist/public/assets/$1" },  <-- This must be BEFORE the fallback
  { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/dist/public/index.html" }       <-- Catch-all fallback last
]
If the /assets/(.*) route is after the fallback, the fallback will intercept requests for JS files and return index.html.

3. Verify Build Output Location
Confirm your build outputs assets inside the folder exactly matching your routing rule, e.g.:

Are your JS files at /dist/public/assets/index-G9WQI6ms.js?

If they’re in a different folder or have a different path prefix, adjust the routes accordingly.

4. Add Debugging Headers Temporarily
To help debug, you can add a custom header in vercel.json for JS files, e.g.:

json
Copy
Edit
"headers": [
  {
    "source": "/assets/(.*).js",
    "headers": [
      { "key": "Content-Type", "value": "application/javascript" },
      { "key": "X-Debug-Asset", "value": "served-js-file" }
    ]
  },
  ...
]
Then check the headers via curl to see if these custom headers appear or if fallback is serving the HTML instead.

5. Test Direct Asset URL Access
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -I https://www.wizqo.com/assets/index-G9WQI6ms.js
If you get a content-disposition: inline; filename="index.html" header, then the fallback route handled it, meaning the static route didn’t match.

6. Try Explicit Static Directory Route
If your assets are under dist/public/assets, try adding this route as well:

json
Copy
Edit
{ "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/dist/public/$1" }
Above the fallback route but below the API route. Or alternatively, use handle: filesystem which should already do this.

7. Redeploy After Changes
Make sure to commit and push your changes to trigger a clean redeploy:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add vercel.json
git commit -m "fix: reorder routes for assets to fix MIME serving issue"
git push origin main
8. Check for Framework Detection Issues
Sometimes Vercel needs the vercel-build script in package.json and correct build outputs to identify static assets correctly.

Summary
Ensure /assets/(.*) route is before fallback

Verify assets path and match routes accordingly

Clear caches and redeploy

Test asset URLs with curl to verify Content-Type

Add debug headers if needed
