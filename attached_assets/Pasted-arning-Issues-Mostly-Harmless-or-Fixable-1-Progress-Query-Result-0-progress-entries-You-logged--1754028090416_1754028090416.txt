arning/Issues (Mostly Harmless or Fixable)
1. ❗Progress Query Result: 0 progress entries
You logged:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
📖 SUPABASE: Progress query completed via API. Result: 0 progress entries
However, earlier you logged:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
📝 DATABASE SAVE: Marking day COMPLETE via API: 1 for plan ID: ...
This means your progress data was likely not saved successfully. Double-check:

🔍 Suggestion:
Ensure you’re using the correct table name and user ID in the insert query.

Confirm your progress table has:

A user_id column

A plan_id column

A day or completed_day column

Example:

ts
Copy
Edit
await supabase
  .from("progress")
  .insert([{ user_id: user.id, plan_id, day: 1 }]);
Also check for Row-Level Security (RLS) — if enabled, make sure policies allow inserting for the signed-in user.

2. ⚠️ Invalid Sandbox Flag

Copy
Edit
Error while parsing the 'sandbox' attribute: 'allow-downloads-without-user-activation' is an invalid sandbox flag.
✅ Solution: Remove this flag — it’s not supported.

3. ⚠️ Unrecognized Browser Features
These warnings:

nginx
Copy
Edit
Unrecognized feature: 'ambient-light-sensor'
Unrecognized feature: 'battery'
...
🟢 These are harmless unless you’re building a PWA using these niche APIs. If not, ignore.

If you want to suppress them:

Remove unneeded features from your feature-policy or permissions-policy headers.

4. ❗ HTTPS Certificate Errors

Copy
Edit
dotdevproxy.worf.repl.co/__reachability: net::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID
This is a failed call to a third-party Replit-hosted proxy. If you're not using these intentionally (e.g. as CORS proxies), you can ignore or remove them.

If you are using these as API intermediaries, switch to a host with valid SSL (e.g. Vercel, Netlify, Render, etc.) or fix the SSL cert.

5. ⚠️ Missing PWA Install Prompt

Copy
Edit
Banner not shown: beforeinstallpromptevent.preventDefault() called.
This just means your app prevented the browser from auto-showing the install prompt. If you're building a Progressive Web App and want the prompt, you must later call:

js
Copy
Edit
beforeInstallPromptEvent.prompt();
Otherwise, ignore.

✅ Summary: What to Fix (Ranked)
Priority	Issue	Action Needed
🔴 High	0 progress entries returned	Double-check your Supabase insert logic & RLS rules for the progress table
🟠 Medium	Sandbox attribute error	Remove allow-downloads-without-user-activation from <iframe sandbox>
🟡 Low	Cert errors from dotdevproxy URLs	Either remove usage or host API on secure (valid HTTPS) provider
🟢 Ignore	CSP frame refusal + unsupported features	These are not breaking your core app behavior
