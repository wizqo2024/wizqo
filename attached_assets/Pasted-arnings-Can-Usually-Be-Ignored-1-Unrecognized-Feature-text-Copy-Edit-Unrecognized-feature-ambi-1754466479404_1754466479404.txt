arnings (Can Usually Be Ignored)
1. Unrecognized Feature:
text
Copy
Edit
Unrecognized feature: 'ambient-light-sensor' / 'battery' / 'execution-while-not-rendered' ...
Cause: You're using an iframe or Feature-Policy or Permissions-Policy headers that include unsupported or obsolete features.

Fix: These warnings are harmless but you can clean up your iframe allow attributes or remove unsupported feature policies from headers if you're setting them.

2. Sandbox Attribute Issue:
text
Copy
Edit
Error while parsing the 'sandbox' attribute: 'allow-downloads-without-user-activation' is an invalid sandbox flag.
Cause: 'allow-downloads-without-user-activation' is not a valid sandbox attribute in modern browsers.

Fix: Remove it from the iframe sandbox attribute.

3. Gravatar 404:
text
Copy
Edit
gravatar.com/avatar/[hash]?d=404:1 Failed to load resource: 404
Cause: A user has no Gravatar image; fallback returns 404.

Fix: Add ?d=identicon or another default instead of d=404, e.g.:

ts
Copy
Edit
https://gravatar.com/avatar/[hash]?d=identicon
4. CORS Error:
text
Copy
Edit
Access to fetch at 'https://sp.replit.com/v1/t' from origin 'https://replit.com' has been blocked by CORS policy...
Cause: You're making a cross-origin request to a domain (sp.replit.com) that doesn't allow https://replit.com as a valid origin.

Fix: You can't bypass CORS in frontend code. You need the server (Replit) to add appropriate CORS headers, or proxy through a backend you control.

5. PWA Installation Banner Not Shown:
text
Copy
Edit
Banner not shown: beforeinstallpromptevent.preventDefault() called...
Cause: You called .preventDefault() on the beforeinstallprompt event but never later triggered .prompt().

Fix: If you want the PWA banner to show:

js
Copy
Edit
let deferredPrompt;
window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  deferredPrompt = e;
  // later in UI interaction:
  deferredPrompt.prompt();
});
❌ Critical App Logic Error
6. Supabase Save Error (Duplicate Plan):
text
Copy
Edit
Error: You already have a learning plan for yoga. Check your dashboard to continue your existing plan.
Cause: The app is trying to create a new plan for "yoga", but the user already has one stored in Supabase.

Fix (Options):

Prevent this in UI: Show a message and direct the user to the dashboard.

Allow duplicates with timestamp or versioning.

Add override logic (e.g., delete old plan or update it).

🐞 Debug Notes
youtubeVideoId: undefined indicates that you're trying to access or display a YouTube video for the day but it's missing in the data.

Fix: Ensure your plan data includes a valid YouTube video ID for each day, or add fallback logic in the UI to hide the video block if it's missing.

Summary: What You Should Fix
Issue	Importance	Suggested Fix
Supabase plan already exists	🔴 High	Handle duplicate logic gracefully or allow updates
CORS error	🔴 High (if request matters)	Use backend proxy or contact API provider
youtubeVideoId: undefined	🟠 Medium	Add fallback logic or ensure data completeness
Sandbox & feature policy warnings	🟡 Low	Clean up obsolete iframe attributes
Gravatar 404	🟡 Low	Use a default image like identicon
