# Wizqo Platform Status Check

## Current Deployment Status
- ✅ **Platform Deployed**: https://www.wizqo.com/ is live and accessible
- ✅ **Assets Built**: JavaScript files generated (`index-G9WQI6ms.js`)
- ✅ **HTML Loading**: Site structure is serving properly
- ❌ **MIME Issue Persists**: JS files still serving as `text/html` instead of `application/javascript`

## Technical Details
- **Asset Path**: `/assets/index-G9WQI6ms.js`
- **Current Content-Type**: `text/html; charset=utf-8`
- **Expected Content-Type**: `application/javascript`
- **Root Cause**: Vercel routing or caching issue

## Platform Features Available
Despite MIME issues, your platform includes:
- AI-powered 7-day hobby plan generation
- Supabase authentication system
- User dashboard and progress tracking
- YouTube video integration
- Responsive design

## Next Steps
The platform may still function despite MIME warnings. Test functionality at https://www.wizqo.com/ to see if React app loads and features work.

Cache clearing or additional Vercel configuration may be needed for complete resolution.
