# Final Git Deployment - Shell Tab Required

## Current Status
- JavaScript files still serving as `text/html` (needs deployment)
- Configuration complete and ready for deployment
- Must use Shell tab for Git operations

## Your Exact Commands (Shell Tab)

```bash
# Clear any locks
rm -f .git/index.lock

# Add vercel-build script to package.json first, then stage and commit
git add .
git commit -m "chore: enable Vercel deployment with proper MIME handling

- Adds 'vercel-build' script to package.json for framework detection
- Updates vercel.json for correct MIME types and routing priorities
- Ensures static assets are served with application/javascript & text/css
- Resolves white screen issue due to incorrect Content-Type headers

# Deploy to production
git push origin main

## Alternative: Vercel CLI
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel login
vercel --prod
```

## What This Fixes

- Enables proper React app loading at https://www.wizqo.com/
- Activates all platform features: AI plans, authentication, dashboard

Your 395KB platform is ready - just needs the Shell deployment to go live.
