# Final MIME Type Solution - Critical Fix

## Root Cause Identified
- Local build: `index-DnQnmhis.js`
- Deployed version requesting: `index-G9WQI6ms.js`
- Route order causing fallback interception

## Solution Applied
✅ Reordered routes with API first, then explicit asset matching
✅ Added file extension matching for assets
✅ Moved filesystem handling after asset routes

## Deploy This Critical Fix:
```bash
rm -f .git/index.lock
git add vercel.json
git commit -m "fix: reorder routes and add explicit asset matching

- Moves API routes first to prevent conflicts
- Adds explicit file extension matching for assets
- Reorders filesystem handling after asset routes
- Should resolve MIME type serving issue definitively" --author="wizqo <wizqo2024@gmail.com>"
git push origin main
```

This routing structure prioritizes asset serving and should finally resolve the MIME type issue!
