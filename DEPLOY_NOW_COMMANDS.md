# Critical Fix - Deploy Updated Assets

## Problem Identified
- The `dist` folder was in `.gitignore` preventing asset deployment
- Production requesting `index-G9WQI6ms.js` but build creates `index-CWH0ADpq.js`

## Solution Applied
✅ Removed `dist/` from `.gitignore` to allow asset deployment
✅ Fresh build generates correct asset references
✅ Ready to deploy updated build with matching assets

## Execute These Commands in Shell:
```bash
rm -f .git/index.lock
git add .gitignore dist/
git commit -m "fix: remove dist from gitignore and deploy correct assets

- Removes dist/ from .gitignore to allow asset deployment
- Includes fresh build with correct asset hashes
- Should resolve 404 errors on JavaScript files" --author="wizqo <wizqo2024@gmail.com>"
git push origin main
```

This will finally deploy the correct build assets that match what the HTML is requesting!
