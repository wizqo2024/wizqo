# Step 2: Clean Branch Approach

The garbage collection didn't resolve the corruption. Now try this clean branch approach in Shell:

```bash
git checkout -b clean-mobile-nav
git push https://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@github.com/wizqo2024/HobbyPlanGen.git clean-mobile-nav:main --force
```

This creates a new branch without the corrupted object history and pushes it directly to GitHub main.

## What This Does:
1. Creates fresh branch `clean-mobile-nav` with all your merged changes
2. Pushes this clean branch to overwrite GitHub main 
3. Bypasses the corrupted object `17c84b3348cd506693491787d558e551e0664beb`

## Alternative if that fails:
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~10
git commit -m "Complete mobile navigation system with all improvements"
git push https://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@github.com/wizqo2024/HobbyPlanGen.git main --force
```

Your code is ready - just need to get around this Git corruption issue.
