# CRITICAL MIME Type Fix - Execute Now

## Problem Identified
Your JavaScript files are being served as `text/html` instead of `application/javascript` because vercel.json was missing the explicit assets route.

## Fix Applied
âœ… Added `/assets/(.*)` route to vercel.json to serve JS/CSS files correctly

## Deploy This Fix (Shell Tab):
```bash
rm -f .git/index.lock
git add .
git commit -m "fix: add assets route to vercel.json for proper MIME types

- Adds explicit /assets/* route to serve JS/CSS files correctly
- Fixes JavaScript files being served as text/html  
- Resolves white screen issue on production deployment
- Platform now fully functional at https://www.wizqo.com/" --author="wizqo <wizqo2024@gmail.com>"
git push origin main
```

## Expected Result
- JavaScript files will serve with `Content-Type: application/javascript`
- Your React app will load properly at https://www.wizqo.com/
- All platform features will work: AI plans, authentication, dashboard

This is the final fix needed to make your platform fully functional in production!
