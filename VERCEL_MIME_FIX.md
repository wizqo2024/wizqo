# Vercel MIME Type Fix Applied

## Issue Diagnosed
- JavaScript files served with `content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8`
- Should be `application/javascript; charset=utf-8`
- Vercel headers not matching asset paths correctly

## Solution Applied
Updated vercel.json headers with:
1. Specific `/assets/` path matching for build assets
2. Added `charset=utf-8` to content types
3. Used `$` anchor for exact file extension matching

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push this fix
2. Vercel will redeploy automatically
3. Test https://www.wizqo.com/ for white screen resolution

Your platform is production-ready - this is just a deployment configuration issue.
