# Vercel Cache Fix - Final Attempt

## Cache Issue Identified
The response shows:
- `x-vercel-cache: HIT`
- `age: 7683` (cached for over 2 hours)
- Still serving old configuration despite deployments

## Solution Applied
✅ Reverted to filesystem handling with proper headers section
✅ Added `Cache-Control: no-cache` to force fresh asset serving
✅ Simplified routing to let Vercel handle assets naturally

## Deploy This Cache-Busting Fix:
```bash
rm -f .git/index.lock
git add vercel.json
git commit -m "fix: add cache-control headers to bust stale cache

- Reverts to filesystem handling with proper headers
- Adds Cache-Control: no-cache to force fresh asset serving
- Should bypass Vercel's stale cached responses" --author="wizqo <wizqo2024@gmail.com>"
git push origin main
```

If this doesn't work, the platform may actually be functional despite MIME warnings - many browsers are tolerant of this issue.
