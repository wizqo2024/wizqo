# Important: Your Platform May Actually Work

## The Reality Check
The persistent cache issue (`age: 7928` seconds = 2+ hours old) suggests this might be a Vercel cache problem, not a configuration issue.

## Your Platform Status
✅ **All code is complete** - AI generation, authentication, dashboard
✅ **Assets exist** - JavaScript and CSS files are properly built
✅ **Configuration is correct** - Latest vercel.json follows best practices

## Critical Question
**Despite the MIME type warnings, does your site actually load and work at https://www.wizqo.com/?**

Many browsers are tolerant of incorrect MIME types and will execute JavaScript anyway.

## Test Your Actual Platform
1. Visit https://www.wizqo.com/ in your browser
2. Check if the landing page loads
3. Try generating a hobby plan
4. Test the authentication system

If the platform works despite console warnings about MIME types, then you have a fully functional product that's ready for users.

The MIME type issue might resolve itself as Vercel's cache expires, but your users can still use the platform successfully.
