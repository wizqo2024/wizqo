# Deploy Smart Hobby Detection System to Live Website

## Current Issue
- Code is pushed but live website not showing recent improvements
- Latest commit only contains deployment fix file, not actual code changes
- Need to deploy the commit with smart hobby system improvements

## Solution: Deploy Specific Commit with Improvements

```bash
# Navigate to the commit with your improvements
git checkout fd48b13

# Create new commit with correct author for deployment
git commit --amend --author="wizqo2024 <wizqo2024@gmail.com>" --no-edit

# Force push this specific commit to main
git push "$GIT_URL" HEAD:main --force

# Then trigger a fresh deployment (clear cache)
# Go to your Vercel dashboard and click "Redeploy" without build cache
```

## Alternative: Manual Vercel Cache Clear
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Click "Deployments"
3. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
4. Uncheck "Use existing Build Cache"
5. Click "Redeploy"

This will deploy commit fd48b13 which contains all your smart hobby detection improvements.
