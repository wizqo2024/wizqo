# Vercel Final Fix - Explicit Asset Routing

## Problem Identified
JavaScript file returns:
- `HTTP/2 200`  
- `content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8`
- `content-disposition: inline; filename="index.html"`

This means the fallback route is catching asset requests before filesystem handling.

## Solution Applied
✅ Added explicit asset routes before filesystem handling
✅ Direct routing with inline headers for JS/CSS files
✅ Prevents fallback route from intercepting asset requests

## Deploy This Final Fix:
```bash
rm -f .git/index.lock
git add vercel.json
git commit -m "fix: add explicit asset routing with inline headers

- Routes JS/CSS files directly to assets with proper content-type
- Prevents fallback route from intercepting asset requests
- Should finally serve JavaScript with application/javascript" --author="wizqo <wizqo2024@gmail.com>"
git push origin main
```

This configuration explicitly routes assets before the fallback, ensuring proper MIME types.
