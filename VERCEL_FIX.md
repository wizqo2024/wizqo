# Vercel Configuration Fixed

## Issue
- vercel.json was corrupted during edit with mixed JSON syntax
- Invalid JSON structure preventing deployment

## Solution Applied
Clean vercel.json with:
- Modern `functions` configuration for Node.js runtime
- `rewrites` instead of legacy `routes`
- Proper asset exclusion: `/((?!assets/).*)`
- Cache headers for static assets

## Next Steps
1. Commit the fixed vercel.json
2. Push to trigger Vercel redeploy
3. Test https://www.wizqo.com/ - should resolve MIME type issue

The configuration now uses Vercel's recommended modern syntax which should properly serve JavaScript assets with correct MIME types.
