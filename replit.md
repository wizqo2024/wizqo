# Wizqo - 7-Day Hobby Learning Platform

## Overview

Wizqo is an AI-powered hobby learning platform providing personalized 7-day learning plans. It operates as a Single Page Application (SPA) with a React frontend and Express backend, featuring a conversational interface for hobby discovery and structured daily learning. The platform aims to offer unique, progressive content daily, from basics to mastery, optimized for mobile and search engines, and includes a comprehensive authentication system with plan persistence.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
GitHub account: wizqo2024@gmail.com (configured for deployment).
Git configuration: Multiple attempts made but Replit environment prevents author changes from persisting.
Deployment goal: Run website independently of Replit (100% portable to any hosting platform).

## System Architecture

The application follows a full-stack architecture with clear separation between client and server components:

**Frontend**:
- **Technology**: React 18 with TypeScript, Vite for development.
- **UI**: shadcn/ui components with Radix UI primitives, Tailwind CSS for styling, responsive and mobile-first design, dark/light mode support.
- **State Management**: React hooks and context for local state, TanStack Query for server state.
- **Routing**: Hash-based SPA routing.
- **Component Structure**: `App.tsx` (main with routing), `LandingPage.tsx`, `ChatInterface.tsx`, `PlanDisplay.tsx`, `Navigation.tsx`, `LoginModal.tsx`, `YouTubeEmbed.tsx`.

**Backend**:
- **Technology**: Express.js server with TypeScript.
- **Structure**: `server/index.ts` (main), `server/routes.ts` (API definitions), `server/storage.ts` (data access), `server/vite.ts` (Vite integration).
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints, health check at `/api/health`, middleware for logging and error handling.

**Data Storage**:
- **Primary Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with Row Level Security (RLS) for data isolation.
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM.
- **Schema**: `supabase/schema.sql` defines `user_profiles`, `hobby_plans`, `user_progress`.
- **Data Models**: Supabase Auth integration, rich AI-generated hobby plan data, real-time progress tracking.

**Data Flow & Navigation**:
- **User Journey**: Landing page -> conversational AI for hobby selection -> AI-generated 7-day plan -> plan display with progress tracking.
- **Navigation**: Home, Learn (conversational AI), Blog (future content hub).
- **Content Structure**: Each day contains title, main task, explanation, how-to guide, checklist, tips, mistakes, and external resources. Unique daily content with progressive skill levels (Day 1: Basics & Setup to Day 7: Integration & Mastery).

## External Dependencies

- **AI Integration**: DeepSeek API for dynamic hobby plan generation.
- **Database & Authentication**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for database, user management, authentication (Google and email/password), and real-time features.
- **Frontend Libraries**: React, React DOM, React Hook Form, Radix UI, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, class-variance-authority, TanStack React Query.
- **Backend Libraries**: Express, Drizzle ORM, node-fetch.
- **Development Tools**: Vite, TypeScript, ESBuild.
- **Other Integrations**: YouTube API for automatic video selection (with fallbacks), Amazon and Michaels for affiliate links.

## Video Selection System

**Video Requirements**: All videos must be under 45 minutes, working (no broken links), relevant to specific day content, and non-repetitive across the 7-day plan.

**Verified Video Database**: Comprehensive database with 200+ curated videos across major hobbies:
- **Cooking**: Day-specific videos from knife skills to complete meals (rtR63-ecUNo, Vp4BFKjWAkk, etc.)
- **Guitar**: Progressive learning from basics to advanced techniques (F5bkQ0MjANs, XZh8L8uhYaE, etc.)
- **Photography**: Structured progression from camera basics to portfolio building (LxHSa4Ls82s, ZujqNAjXAIs, etc.)
- **Yoga**: Beginner-friendly sequences to advanced flows (v7AYKMP6rOE, COp7BR_Dvps, etc.)
- **Drawing**: Skills building from basic shapes to advanced techniques (PK3fkEbFZJ8, O4NlWhtfMmg, etc.)

**Smart Fallback System**: 
1. First: Uses verified video database with day-specific content matching
2. Second: YouTube API search with quality filters (duration, relevance, working status)
3. Third: Generic fallback videos as last resort

**Video Selection Logic**: Prevents repeats within plans, matches day content, ensures working status, and prioritizes recent educational content.

## Current Status (August 2025)

**Recently Completed Fixes**:
- Continue Plan button navigation - FIXED (navigates to correct #/plan route)
- AI chat functionality after plan generation - WORKING (intelligent contextual responses with DeepSeek API + fallback)
- YouTube video system - OPTIMIZED (working fallback system handles API quota limits)
