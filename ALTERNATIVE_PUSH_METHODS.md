# Alternative Git Push Methods

## Current Issue
The git push hasn't completed successfully yet. Let's try different approaches.

## Method 1: Check Git Configuration
In Shell tab, run these commands to verify setup:
```bash
git config --list | grep remote
git remote -v
```

## Method 2: Try Different Push Syntax
```bash
git push https://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@github.com/wizqo2024/HobbyPlanGen.git replit-agent:main --force
```

## Method 3: Push to Different Branch
```bash
git push origin replit-agent --force
```

## Method 4: Create GitHub Release
1. Download project as ZIP from Replit
2. Go to GitHub.com/wizqo2024/HobbyPlanGen
3. Upload files through web interface
4. Or use "Upload files" button

## Method 5: Replit Deploy Integration
Look for:
- Deploy button in Replit
- GitHub integration in settings
- Automatic sync options

## What Needs to Upload
- Mobile hamburger dropdown navigation
- Responsive layout (768px breakpoint)
- Account menu integration
- All recent mobile improvements

Your changes are safely committed locally - we just need to find the right method to sync with GitHub.
