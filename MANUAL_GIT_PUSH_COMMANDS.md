# Manual Git Push Commands - UPDATED

## Current Status
- Git operations are blocked by lock files - need manual Shell intervention
- Smart hobby detection improvements committed locally
- Need to push using GIT_URL method that worked before

## EXACT Shell Commands (Copy & Paste)
Open Shell tab and run these commands one by one:

```bash
# Navigate to workspace
cd /home/runner/workspace

# Clear any Git locks (CRITICAL STEP)
rm -f .git/*.lock .git/refs/heads/*.lock .git/index.lock 2>/dev/null || true

# Kill hanging Git processes  
pkill -f git 2>/dev/null || true

# Check status
git status

# First merge changes to main branch
git checkout main
git merge independence-migration

# Push to main using the working GIT_URL method
git push "$GIT_URL" main

# Alternative if above fails:
git push https://wizqo2024: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@github.com/wizqo2024/HobbyPlanGen main
```

## Recent Improvements Committed
✓ Smart hobby detection system with intelligent matching
✓ Expanded keyword database with synonyms and variations  
✓ YouTube video system working with proper fallbacks
✓ Amazon affiliate links with daily product progression
✓ Synchronized frontend/backend validation
✓ Accept reasonable hobby inputs instead of rejecting everything
✓ Only reject truly nonsensical inputs (hmm, um, bye, etc.)

## Alternative: Use Replit's Git Panel
If shell commands fail:
1. Click the Git icon in Replit's sidebar
2. Select "Push" 
3. Choose the `independence-migration` branch
4. Push to origin
