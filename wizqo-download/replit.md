# Wizqo - 7-Day Hobby Learning Platform

## Overview

Wizqo is a hobby learning platform that provides AI-powered, personalized 7-day learning plans for any hobby. The application is built as a Single Page Application (SPA) with a React frontend and Express backend, featuring a conversational interface for hobby discovery and structured daily learning plans.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
GitHub account: wizqo2024@gmail.com (configured for deployment).
Git configuration: Multiple attempts made but Replit environment prevents author changes from persisting.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation between client and server components:

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, using Vite for development and bundling
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for data modeling
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS for styling
- **State Management**: React hooks and context for local state, TanStack Query for server state
- **Routing**: Hash-based SPA routing for client-side navigation

## Deployment Strategy

**Development Environment**:
- Vite dev server for frontend with hot module replacement
- Express server in development mode with TypeScript compilation
- Database migrations managed through Drizzle Kit
- Replit-specific plugins for development experience

**Production Build**:
- Frontend: Vite builds to `dist/public` directory
- Backend: ESBuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
- Static file serving through Express in production mode
- Database connection via environment variable (DATABASE_URL)

**Key Scripts**:
- `npm run dev`: Development mode with hot reloading
- `npm run build`: Production build for both frontend and backend
- `npm run start`: Production server startup
- `npm run db:push`: Database schema synchronization

The application is designed to be deployment-ready for platforms like Replit, Vercel, or traditional hosting environments with minimal configuration changes.
